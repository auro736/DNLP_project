# Extensions to the paper "Two is better than many? Binary classification as an effective approach to Multi-Choice Question Answering".

This repository contains the extensions based on the paper ["Two is better than many? Binary classification as an effective approach to Multi-Choice Question Answering"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16495v1) (source code [here](https://github.com/declare-lab/TEAM/)) in order to expand the context of use of the innovative method. 

The extensions are:

1. Application of the model on a Persian dataset, taken from [ParsiNLU: A Suite of Language Understanding Challenges for Persian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06154).
2. Application of the model on a clarified version of the PIQA dataset, taken from [Unsupervised Commonsense Question Answering with Self-Talk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05483)

## Results
To reproduce the results, please follow these steps:

1. Download the "Persian.ipynb" and "Piqa_clarified.ipynb" files via the following links: 

    [Persian](https://www.dropbox.com/s/976hxoapgvwnvdn/Persian.ipynb?dl=0), 
    [PIQA clarified](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3mrfldstqa0v6kb/Piqa_clarified.ipynb?dl=0)

2. Import the desired file into Google Colaboratory.
3. Run the indicated cells to reproduce the results.

Please note that the paths in files are dependent on Google Colaboratory, so it is essential to use that environment to run the code successfully.
